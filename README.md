Office Assassin
===============

What is this?
-------------
The combination of an office full of developers picking up nerf weapons without any direction -
[see wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_\(game\)), and me wanting to learn scala and how it might look
living with an existing java stuff (like jersey).

What it is not?
---------------
* This is most likely NOT a good example of scala
* This is NOT a good example of how I would actually implement a fairly simple app
* This is NOT a good example of the level of testing I would add to a real project. The test coverage is pretty crappy,
 and usually only exists for things where it was easier to write a test than fire the app up.
* This is probably NOT useful - even if this ever reaches a point where a usable app is produced, it will just be an app
 to assign someone a target and track when someone else says that they hit them.

License
-------
* Ummmm... if your really interested in re-using any of this code I would probably advise against it, but since it
 does bother me to see a project on github without a clear license, think Apache - I may put the proper files and
 notices in at some point, but if it really matters file a bug and force me to do it.
